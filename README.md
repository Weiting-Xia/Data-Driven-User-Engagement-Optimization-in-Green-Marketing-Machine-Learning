**🌱 I. Background**  
IdleFish, a large second-hand trading platform, launched a low-carbon themed marketing campaign. However, limited promotion effectiveness and channel reach resulted in low user traffic and weak engagement.

**🎯 II. Objective**  
Analyze the effectiveness of green marketing initiatives, identify key factors influencing user participation, and propose data-driven strategies to improve engagement and campaign performance.

**📚 III. Methodology**  
Literature review → build **VBN** & **FASCT** models.  
Interviews & data mining → understand motivations and current practices.  
Survey → 1,064 responses, 877 valid (82.6%), reliable and valid results.  

**🌿 IV. Main Analysis**  
Assess users’ **environmental awareness** and **engagement**.  
Use **PCA** and **logistic regression** to find factors affecting acceptance.  
Apply **cluster** and **discriminant analysis** + **collaborative filtering** to segment users and recommend personalized green marketing plans.  

**💡 V. Key Recommendations**  
Link eco-actions to **personal rewards**, improve **promotion transparency**, adopt **differentiated strategies**, and highlight users’ **environmental contributions** to make IdleFish’s green marketing more effective and engaging.
